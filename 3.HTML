  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
  JavaScript is an object-based script programming language. This language is primarily used within web browsers and has the ability to access built-in objects from other applications.
  It is also used for server-side network programming, such as runtime environments like Node.js.
  </p>
  <p>
   JavaScript was originally developed by Netscape Communications Corporation's Brendan Ike, first named Mocha, later called LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. Although JavaScript is syntactically similar to Sun Microsystems' Java, this is because both languages ​​are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related. Except for its name and syntax, it has more similarities to self and schemes than Java.
