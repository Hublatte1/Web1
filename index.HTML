  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
  The World Wide Web (WWW, W3) is a global information space where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet. Often called simply the Web. The term is often used synonymously with the Internet, but is strictly different. The web is just one service that runs on the Internet, like e-mail. However, since 1993, the web has been the absolute location of the Internet structure.
